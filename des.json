Once there, life moves at a slower pace. You can swim in the calm sea, cycle along the coast, or explore small fishing villages nearby. For adventure, boat trips to nearby islands offer opportunities for snorkeling and exploring coral reefs.One of Ngapali’s highlights is its seafood. Freshly caught prawns, squid, and fish are grilled and served right by the shore, offering a taste of local flavor at its best. And when evening comes, Ngapali truly shines — sunsets over the Bay of Bengal are some of the most breathtaking in Myanmar.Relaxation, couples, nature lovers, and anyone seeking a peaceful getaway.</u></p>"
